#Define a search space — something simple like integers, binary, reals, vectors, etc. is fine — or your choice!

#finding factors of a number? 




#Define an objective function on the search space — something easily implemented in an algorithm.





#Define variation operators on elements of the search space — mutation, recombination, etc., something easily implemented in an algorithm.





#Decide on a selection operator — fitness proportional to the objective function, tournament, rank order, truncation, or your choice.
